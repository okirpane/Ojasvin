                    Simple Timer (ST) is a physical object that helps you focus on work while taking healthy breaks in
                    the middle. The device breaks down work into increasingly long intervals of time, gradually
                    encouraging the user to work longer while compartmentalizing time for breaks and helping the user be
                    more organised.

                    THE BEGINNING

                <div class="module-text">
                    I was inspired by the Pomodoro Technique and productivity apps like Forest.<br>

                    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
                    The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
                    separated by short breaks.<br>

                    Forest is a productivity app made to help you focus on a task. Every time you want to focus you
                    plant a tree that will grow as long as you focus on the task you want to accomplish and will die if
                    you leave the app and get distracted.<br>

                    I have used both these apps/techniques on my phone and neither has been particularly good at
                    increasing my productivity. All the productivity apps I have used on my phone have only resulted in
                    me checking my phone every five minutes to surf the internet and access social media.<br>

                    I sketched a few ideas for the timer. This was particularly difficult, as I had to communicate
                    information to the user without text or distracting, complex visuals.

                    I took the concept of the pomodoro timer and modified it a little. I added a counter that increases
                    the interval length every time you work. I changed the trademark red colour of the pomodoro timer to
                    a more inviting blue as the red colour was extremely piercing in the dark. I also added mood-lights
                    that act as a kind of nightlight/soothing background light, but after a few days of testing it
                    myself, I found that it wasnâ€™t really effective.

                    The Mario themed alarm was effective at being a striking tune that pleasantly reminded me when to
                    work and when to relax. When I used a generic alarm tune I went into work in a bad mood, almost
                    dreading work. The Mario theme delighted me whenever I heard it.

                    I have eventually stripped down the object to be a device that breaks down work into increasingly
                    long intervals of time to gradually encourage the user to work longer while compartmentalizing time
                    and helping the user be more organised..

                    The next steps I wish to take is installing a way to interact with my phone. maybe develop an app to lock my phone for the duration of my work interval in order to make this device more effective. I would also like to make the shell sleeker and smaller by using a smaller Micro controller, using different material (maybe 3D-printed filament, acrylic, etc) and using different joinery methods to make the shell more classy.
