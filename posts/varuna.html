                    Varuna is a low-cost EMR (Electronic Medical Records) & Scheduling System. The goal of the project
                    is to give doctors all the power of a departmental EMR in a small, cheap & beautifully designed
                    package. We want to make healthcare products deflationary (in cost) and democratized.

                <div class="module-text">
                    This project started in March 2020. In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. My partner & I were
                    talking to his mother (a doctor) who was complaining about the troubles she was having with the
                    medical software she was using.<br>
                    Her hospital's digital systems were clunky and ugly while third part applications were expensive and
                    irresponsible with data collection. Intrigued by this we did some research and found that her
                    complaints were true.

                    We decided to seize the opportunity & quickly build an MVP. We kept the development process
                    functional & the software light-weight.<br>
                    The process started with assumptions about users. We started building on those assumptions & rapidly
                    tested them in real-time with real users.

                <div class="module-text">
                    We started making rapidly developed, bespoke landing pages for doctors with SEO support to encourage
                    them to sign up
                    for our service. This encouraged doctors to get through the somewhat tedious task of signing up, &
                    our SEO + superior site design increased patient sign-ups as well.

                <div class="module-text">
                    We refined the UI. We came up with a useful design metaphor called a "card". Basically, points of
                    iteraction & related information was broken up into modules called cards. This helped us modularize
                    the information the user interfaced with, and guide them along simple, well-defined steps of
                    interaction.<br>
                    Through our rapid user-testing we found that we needed to pay more attention to hard-data of
                    interface confusion, goal-attainment, etc. rather than user suggestions or opinions.

                    We decided to build a frontend for more robust open-source EMR projects like OpenEMR. When we looked
                    into it, we discovered that OpenEMR has a lot of pwerful features, but is inaccessible to most
                    people. Setting it up takes a lot of technical know-how & the lacklustre user experience is
                    difficult to inerface with.<br>
                    We are currently in the middle of developing a front-end with NuxtJS.

                    Our changes to the experience did solve our initial problems but, we found that we couldn't pursue
                    our ambitions for the project without external funding. We decided to look for funding to bolster
                    our marketing efforts & hardware production.
